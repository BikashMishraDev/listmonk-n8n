# Contributing to listmonk-n8n

First off, thank you for considering contributing to listmonk-n8n. It's people like you that make listmonk-n8n such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the listmonk-n8n Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to lucas.sovre@proton.me.

## Did you find a bug?

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/LucasSovre/listmonk-n8n/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of listmonk-n8n will generally not be accepted.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change under [Issues](https://github.com/LucasSovre/listmonk-n8n/issues) and start writing code.
- Do not open a pull request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are a great way to propose a feature or collect feedback on an idea before writing code.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You can simply do it with :
```bash
npm version patch
```
6. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a another reviewer to merge it for you.
